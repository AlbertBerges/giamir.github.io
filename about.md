Iâ€™m [Giamir](/quirky-name), an Italian engineer working as a Software Developer at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com).

I'm focused on sustainable software development: growing high-quality, maintainable, well-tested software is what I care about. Object-oriented design principles and Agile Methodologies are my bread and butter.

I'm particularly passionate about JavaScript, but I'm a polyglot by nature: during the years I've played with Ruby, PHP, Python and Java, either for work or for fun. I worked as a freelance web designer in the past and I have experience in making user interface nice and usable. It's very easy to find me playing with the latest HTML and CSS features.
